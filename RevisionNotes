Tense depends on when the action is done — past, present, or future.

📌 2. Four Main Types of Sentences
Tense Type	Use When...	Example
Indefinite	Action is done, but not continuous	I ate food.
Continuous	Action is still going	I am eating food.
Perfect	Action is fully completed	I have eaten food.

V1	Present base form	eat, go

✅ V1/V2: Can be used without help.
